    <h3><p>Varkala is a town in the south Indian state of Kerala. Itâ€™s on the Arabian Sea and
         known for Varkala Beach, backed by palm-covered red cliffs. Just south,
         Papanasam Beach is believed to have holy waters. On a nearby hill, the ancient
         Janardanaswamy Temple is a Hindu pilgrimage site dedicated to Vishnu. Farther inland, 
         the Sivagiri Mutt monument memorializes the social reformer Sree Narayana Guru,
         who is buried here.</p></h3>
